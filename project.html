        <br>INTRODUCTION:
        <p> 
Code visualization bridges the gap between what you think your system looks like and what it actually looks like—helping you understand what you’re working with and making it easier to organize and collaborate with confidence.
In this article, we’ll explain why you should visualize your coding systems, the best diagrams to use, and tips for getting started so your next development project is a success.  
Visualizing code is essential for clean, efficient, and effective development. When you’re working in the weeds of complex architectures, it is easy to lose sight of the big picture. You may have some outlines of your future state and a hierarchical filing system, but theoretical documents and a few folders don’t help you understand what your code looks like right now. 
Visual documentation of your code ensures you not only have the details organized but that they are conceptualized in a more accessible way. 
<br>Visualizing code helps you:
        <li>Identify and fix bugs.</li>
        <li>Conceptualize large-scale projects.</li>
        <li>Visualize dependencies.</li>
        <li>Collaborate with others.</li>
        <li>Onboard new software developers.</li>
        <li>Understand the user flow.</li>
In other words, code visualization helps you model what you want the code to look like, understand what it actually looks like, and expose issues and opportunities to simplify the design. 
Diagrams help you visualize your code in an organized, easy-to-understand format. Below are three common diagrams that streamline the code documentation and visualization process.

            <h1>STACK</h1>
                <p  class=>Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
                    There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In First Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.  <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/" target="_blank" class="hero-btn">See More</a>

            <h1>QUEUE</h1>
                <p  class=>A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure/" target="_blank" class="hero-btn">See More</a>

            <h1>SINGLE-LINKED LIST</h1>
                <p  class=>Singly linked list can be defined as the collection of ordered set of elements. The number of elements may vary according to need of the program. A node in the singly linked list consist of two parts: data part and link part. Data part of the node stores actual information that is to be represented by the node while the link part of the node stores the address of its immediate successor.One way chain or singly linked list can be traversed only in one direction. In other words, we can say that each node contains only next pointer, therefore we can not traverse the list in the reverse direction.  <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/singly-linked-list" target="_blank" class="hero-btn">See More</a></p>

            <h1>DOUBLY LINKED-LIST</h1>
                <p  class=>Doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list in which a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the sequence. Therefore, in a doubly linked list, a node consists of three parts: node data, pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer) , pointer to the previous node (previous pointer).n a singly linked list, we could traverse only in one direction, because each node contains address of the next node and it doesn't have any record of its previous nodes. However, doubly linked list overcome this limitation of singly linked list. Due to the fact that, each node of the list contains the address of its previous node, we can find all the details about the previous node as well by using the previous address stored inside the previous part of each node.<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/doubly-linked-list" target="_blank" class="hero-btn">See More</a></p>

                <p  class=>In a circular Singly linked list, the last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list. We can have circular singly linked list as well as circular doubly linked list.We traverse a circular singly linked list until we reach the same node where we started. The circular singly liked list has no beginning and no ending. There is no null value present in the next part of any of the nodes.<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/circular-singly-linked-list" target="_blank" class="hero-btn">See More</a></p>

            <h1>TREES</h1>
                <p  class=>A tree is also one of the data structures that represent hierarchical data.A tree data structure is defined as a collection of objects or entities known as nodes that are linked together to represent or simulate hierarchy.A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels.In the Tree data structure, the topmost node is known as a root node. Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. In the above tree structure, the node contains the name of the employee, so the type of data would be a string.Each node contains some data and the link or reference of other nodes that can be called children.<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/tree" target="_blank" class="hero-btn">See More</a></p>

A graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the vertices (Nodes) maintain any complex relationship among them instead of having parent child relationship.A graph G can be defined as an ordered set G(V, E) where V(G) represents the set of vertices and E(G) represents the set of edges which are used to connect these vertices.<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/ds-graph" target="_blank" class="hero-btn">See More</a></p>
